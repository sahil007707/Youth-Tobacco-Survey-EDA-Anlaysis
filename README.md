# 🧠 Youth Tobacco Survey - EDA & Analysis

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the *Youth Tobacco Survey in Indian States*. The analysis dives deep into patterns, trends, and insights related to tobacco usage among youth across different states in India.

## 📊 Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- To understand the prevalence of tobacco use among youth in various Indian states.
- To identify patterns based on gender, age group, and geographic distribution.
- To use visualization tools to uncover hidden insights.
- To perform statistical analysis including correlation and dimensionality reduction using PCA.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is titled:

**"Youth Tobacco Survey In Indian States"**

It contains structured survey responses, which include:

- State-wise tobacco usage
- Gender and age distribution
- Type of tobacco product used
- Awareness and exposure to anti-tobacco messages

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for PCA and preprocessing
- **Scipy** for statistical analysis

## 📌 Key Steps in Analysis

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and data types.
   - Ensured the dataset was clean and structured for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualized distributions of tobacco usage.
   - Compared usage patterns across states and gender.
   - Identified correlations between variables.

3. **Statistical Summary**
   - Computed skewness, kurtosis, and correlation coefficients.
   - Interpreted the distributional properties of the dataset.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to simplify the dataset while retaining most of the information.

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

- Bar plots of tobacco usage by state
- Heatmaps of correlations
